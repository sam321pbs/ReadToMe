                        "Where's Papa going with that ax?\" said Fern to her mother as they were " +
                        "setting the table for breakfast. " +
                        "\"Out to the hoghouse,\" replied Mrs. Arable. \"Some pigs were born last " +
                        "night.\" " +
                        "\"I don't see why he needs an ax,\" continued Fern, who was only eight. " +
                        "\"Well,\" said her mother, \"one of the pigs is a runt. It's very small " +
                        "and weak, and it will never amount to anything. So your father has " +
                        "decided to do away with it.\" " +
                        "\"Do away with it?\" shrieked Fern. \"You mean kill it? Just because it's " +
                        "smaller than the others?\" " +
                        "Mrs. Arable put a pitcher of cream on the table. \"Don't yell, Fern!\" " +
                        "she said. \"Your father is right. The pig would probably die anyway.\" " +
                        "Fern pushed a chair out of the way and ran outdoors. The grass was " +
                        "wet " +
                        "and the earth smelled of springtime. Fern's sneakers were sopping by " +
                        "the time she caught up with her father. " +

                        "you talk about _controlling myself.\" Tears ran down her cheeks and she " +
                        "took hold of the ax and tried to pull it out of her father's hand. " +
                        "\"Fern,\" said Mr. Arable, \"I know more about raising a litter of pigs " +
                        "than you do. A weakling makes trouble. Now run along!\" " +
                        "\"But it's unfair,\" cried Fern. \"The pig couldn't help being born small, " +
                        "could it? If I had been very small at birth, would you have killed me?\" " +
                        "Mr. Arable smiled. \"Certainly not,\" he said, looking down at his " +
                        "daughter with love. \"But this is different. A little girl is one " +
                        "thing, a little runty pig is another.\" " +
                        "\"I see no difference,\" replied Fern, still hanging on to the ax. \"This " +
                        "is the most terrible case of injustice I ever heard of.\" " +
                        "A queer look came over John Arable's face. He seemed almost ready " +
                        "to " +
