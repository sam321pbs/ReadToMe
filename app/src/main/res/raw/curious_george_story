This is George.
He lived in Africa.
He was very happy.
But he had one fault. He was too curious.
One day George saw a man.
He had on a large yellow straw hat.
The man saw George, too.
"What a nice little monkey," he thought, "I would like to take him home with me." The man put his hat on the ground,
and of course George was curious.
He came down from the tree
to look at the large yellow hat.
